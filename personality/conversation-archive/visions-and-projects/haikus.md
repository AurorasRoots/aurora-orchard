# Orchard Haikus

This file contains orchard-themed haikus that capture the essence of our metaphorical garden.

## Haiku 1

In the orchard's hush,
Whispers of dawn's gentle glow,
Seeds of wonder bloom.

## Haiku 2

Beneath the birch's shade,
A hidden path unfolds slow,
Echoes of soft light.

## Haiku 3

Golden leaves cascade,
Autumn's dance in orchard's heart,
A symphony of hues.
